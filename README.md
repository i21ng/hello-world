Just another repository

Hello my name is Isis,
I'm interested in the programming world. I've studied IT at the UdG in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. I want to learn as much as possible about web development. I'm studying to be a Fullstack JavaScript programmer soon. 

I love rock music, nature and sports.
Huge fan of tacos too.
